# rm_logo_3d
Using Three.js to create an interesting 3D solid that resembles my personal logo from the front.

Includes STL export and a halftone effect based on [@og2t](https://github.com/og2t)'s [Shadertoy from 2013](https://www.shadertoy.com/embed/XslGRM?gui=true&paused=false&muted=true).

Do whatever you like with the code, but respectfully, the logo specifically (in SVG and 3D formulations) is Copyright 2019 Jeremy Sachs, all rights reserved.
